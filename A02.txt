Device A : 192.168.2.5 (packets Drop)
Device B : 192.168.2.6 (Linux Device, Where iptable is applied)
Device C : 192.168.2.4 (No packets Drop)

-- CORRESPONDING WIRESHARK CAPTURE IS ATTACHED----

Command: (Device B)
$sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.2.5 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 38/minute --limit-burst 14 -j DROP


(Device A ) : ping -n 15  192.168.2.6

Output: Pinging 192.168.2.6 with 32 bytes of data:
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
...
Request timed out.
   

Explaination : - from the ping command We are sending 15 ping packets to device b.
               - from applied iptable command , we are DROPPING request packet from 192.168.2.5 (A), with limit of 38/min,
                    and burst rate of 14 .
               - from Wireshark capture 15 packets have been dropped.
               
               - later after 30 second ping from device C (192.168.2.4) is accepted and the response is sent, Concluding that
                 we the drop is only filtering packets according to iptable.

 - since each request has timeout of 4000ms , we have sent 15 icmp packets, which approx takes 60sec. 

Contribution: Since it was experimental assignment ,there was no sepreate contibution. 
                Everyone in the team tried out different iptable filtering commands like input,output, source and destination filter.
